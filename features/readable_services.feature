Feature: Potential customer can read about services

In order to generate more leads for my business
As a business owner
I want web users to be able to read about my services

Background:
    Given I have provisioned the following infrastructure:
    | Server Name   | Operating System  | Version   | Chef Version  | Run List              |
    | wonderstuff   | ubuntu            | 12.04     | 11.4.4        | wonderstuff::default  |
    And I have run Chef

Scenario: User visits home page
    Given a url "http://wonderstuff-design.me"
    When a web user browses to the URL
    Then the user should see "Wonderstuff Design is a boutique graphics design agency."
